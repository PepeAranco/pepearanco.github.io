	<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I was most inspired by the home page of <a href="http://talkpr.com" target="_blank">TalkPR</a> and by the home page of <a href="http://www.atelierdesbains.com" target="_blank">Atelier Desbains.</a></p>
	
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>TalkPR uses a very clear focal point, a big, colorful and dynamic logo, centered on a white background. Hierarchy is clear, the text under the logo describes the company in a few words, giving the user the basic information about the brand in big black letters. The menu bar at the bottom of the page contributes in my opinion to the focal point and hierarchy by centering the users attention on the first two objects. User will naturally scroll down to see more, this action prompts the menu bar to move to the top of the page, where most users are used to se it.For the following content I like the choice of a 4 column grid, combining colorful images and squares with a little text, presenting them in different shapes and sizes but keeping certain structure.</p>
	<p>Atelier Desbains caught my attention because of the use of a very dark image as white space, creates a huge contrast with the rest of the page. As we scroll down, big white backgrounds with small centered and gray text, and 3 column grids with bold, colorful images make this a very easy and pleasant website to look at, user should easily find what they are looking for.</p>
	
	<h2>What makes them similar and different</h2>
	<p>Both sites have a strong presence as soon as you land on the home page and develop their information to the user as we scroll down the page. The main difference I found is on the use of white space. Atelier Desbains uses a lot of white space as we scroll down the page, simple and organized content in a 3 column format. Talk PR uses almost the entire with of the site with the table, the white spaces are sort of incorporated in the columns given the visual effect of the text boxes mixed in with the images.</p>
	
	<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><figure><h3>Home Page</h3>
		<img src="homepage2.jpg" alt="home" height="700" widht"400">
		<figcaption>This sketch page shows two different option for my the home page of my wedding website. In the first option there will be a big image on a white background as a focal point, followed by a frase with a call to action with the menu bar on the bottom.</figcaption>
		<figcaption>The second option has a larger image as a focal point and menu bar on the top of the page. the CTA in this case will be on the image itself.</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li><h3>Our Story Page</h3>
		<img src="ourstory.jpg" alt="Our Story" height="700" widht"400">
		<p>In this case we have two different options, the first would be just one big image with an infographic telling our story, user will instinctively know to scroll down the page to see more content.</p>
		<p>The second option its a little more classic, with an image on the left side and wrapping text</p></li>
		<li><h3>Our Story According to You</h3>
		<img src="byyou.jpg" alt="Our Story According to You" height="700" widht"400">
		<p>This is one the the most important sections of our website, is where we ask our loved ones to tell our story for us, for this we will use a simple CTA as a focal point on top of the page, followed by  thumnails of the testimonials left by other users in a 3 column format and a button to "submit yours" at the bottom of the page.</p>
		<p>The second option will also have the CTA as a focal point on top of the page but the thumbnails would be aligned to the left, with the text next to them.</p></li>
		<li><h3>La Fiesta</h3>
		<img src="lafiesta.jpg" alt="La Fiesta" height="700" widht"400">
		<p>Here is where all the important information will be displayed, the first option includes a bold title stating what is this information about, as a focal point, and centered text under it. and an embeded google map plug-in at the end of the page</p>
		<p>In the second option we can see a longer page, a Big Focal point text at the top, followed by the google maps plug-in and at as we keep scrolling down we will find thumbnail links for the users to click on and find Hotels, Camping and Transportation</p></li>
